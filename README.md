## 👋 Hello! My name is Trinity Wilson!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. Thanks for stopping by!

🎓 I’m a 19-year-old student and I've recently completed my third year at **Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)**, where I’m passionate about cybersecurity, technology policy, and digital ethics.

🔍 I created this space to showcase **resume-building projects** and **independent research** as I work toward landing an **internship in cyber policy analysis**, a career path I’m deeply committed to. From hands-on technical projects to thought pieces on digital governance, I’m constantly learning, exploring, and growing my skills.

📁 **Check out my projects below** >>I’m always adding new work, and I welcome feedback or collaboration!
